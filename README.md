SMITE - Damage Calculator.

An Android app. It's a tool for SMITE players. SMITE's a MOBA videogame.
This is a little project I made in 2018-2019. It's a kind of calculator you could use to compare damage between "builds", "gods" and other things in the game. Now it's outdated and it's no longer useful because the game kept updating and changing.

You can download it from Google Play Store:

Here I describe a bit more about this :)

The app is coded with Python. There's a Python library called Kivy that allows you to "package" your code in the form of applications, with buttons, input fields, etc.
Those applications, with the appropiate configuration (packaging, compiling), can be used on Android.

So that's what I did, and here's the source code. If you would like to comprehend the code and make something about this, please tell me. But I don't think I will work on this project anymore.
