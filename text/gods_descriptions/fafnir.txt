   Considered combo:

   -Start as a dwarf.
   -Use COERCE.
   -Use UNDERHANDED TACTICS.
   -Use CURSED STRENGTH.
   -Immediately do some basic attacks OR use DRAGONIC CORRUPTION.
   -Continue as a dragon.
   -Use COERCE.
   -Use UNDERHANDED TACTICS.
   -Use CURSED STRENGTH.
   -Attack with dragon basics.


   You can active each ability of each phase, individually, using the diamond buttons.

   If you active COERCE, the damage of CURSED STRENGTH, UNDERHANDED TACTICS and the normal/dragon basics will be increased.
   In this calculation, COERCE doesn't affect the damage of the three ticks of DRAGONIC CORRUPTION.

   You can specify the number of dragon basics attacks, with the "D. Bas" input box down on the right.
