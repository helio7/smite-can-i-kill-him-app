            HACHIMAN

 Skill 3:
   - 1 damage tick.
   - 2 damage ticks.

   The ability 1 will give you 3 or 4 special basic attacks. Those basics will have a damage buff within certain distance, and another buff if they are landed beyond. You can select the number of basic attacks landed near with the "Sk1 bas:" input box.
   For example, if you select "2", with the ability 1 level being 2:
   - the damage of 2 basic attacks affected by the "within buff" will be added.
   - the damage of 1 basic attack affected by the "beyond buff" will be added.

   If you don't want to mess with all this, and you simply want the maximum damage from the ability 1, you can simply put a "4" or a "5" in the "Sk1 bas:" input box.
